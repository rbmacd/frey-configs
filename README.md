Network Device Configuration Files Managed by Frey

This repo's sole usage is for storing network device configuration files that are managed by the Frey project.  

These files are not intended for actual use, but are instead examples for others.  Frey users are expected to create their own git repo for tracking their own specific configuration files.

FOR PRODUCTION USAGE, SAVE THESE CONFIGS TO A PRIVATE/SECURE REPO.  RUNNING CONFIGS INCLUDE PASSWORD HASHES.
